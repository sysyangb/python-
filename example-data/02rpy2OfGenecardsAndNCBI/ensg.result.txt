ENSG00000037474	NSUN2 	NOP2/Sun RNA methyltransferase 2 	protein coding	This gene encodes a methyltransferase that catalyzes the methylation of cytosine to 5-methylcytosine (m5C) at position 34 of intron-containing tRNA(Leu)(CAA) precursors. This modification is necessary to stabilize the anticodon-codon pairing and correctly translate the mRNA. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been noted for this gene.[provided by RefSeq, Mar 2011]	"54888"	"25994"	"Minus strand"	"34,053 bases"	"chr5:6,599,239-6,633,291"
ENSG00000183684	ALYREF 	Aly/REF export factor 	protein coding	The protein encoded by this gene is a heat stable, nuclear protein and functions as a molecular chaperone. It is thought to regulate dimerization, DNA binding, and transcriptional activity of basic region-leucine zipper (bZIP) proteins.

ENSG00000140718	FTO 	FTO alpha-ketoglutarate dependent dioxygenase 	protein coding	This gene is a nuclear protein of the AlkB related non-haem iron and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenase superfamily but the exact physiological function of this gene is not known. Other non-heme iron enzymes function to reverse alkylated DNA and RNA damage by oxidative demethylation. Studies in mice and humans indicate a role in nervous and cardiovascular systems and a strong association with body mass index, obesity risk, and type 2 diabetes.
